In this homework, the system of linear equations are solved using the methods that were practiced in HW4 as:
- Gaussian Elimination and Back substitution
- LU decomposition
- Cholesky decomposition
- Gauss-Jordan method
- Jacobi Iterative method
- Gauss-Seidel iterative method
- Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)
- Thomas Algorithm for tridiagonal matrix

The above numerical methods will be coded in Python (manual method)
and then the available automatic functions from scipy will be used. 
Finally the results will be compared
