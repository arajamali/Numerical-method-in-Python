In each folder, the problem statement and solution files are included.
The solution folder may contains .ipynb, .pdf and .xlsx files
In this Read_me, a brief explanation about each homework will be presented as:

            List-comprehension
            Matrix transpose and matrix multiplication
            Dictionary in Python
            ASCII code
            Combination of 6 dices
            Clock combination (different scenarios) 

Homework 3:
            3D data visualization (mpl_toolkits.mplot3d)
            Practices on Scipy, Numpy, and Sympy
            
Homework 4:
            System of linear equations. This homework is done in EXCEL and the following methods are practiced
            - Gaussian Elimination and Back substitution
            - LU decomposition
            - Cholesky decomposition
            - Gauss-Jordan method
            - Jacobi Iterative method
            - Gauss-Seidel iterative method
            - Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)
            - Thomas Algorithm for tridiagonal matrix
            
Homework 5:
            In this homework, the system of linear equations are solved using the methods that were practiced in HW4 as:
            - Gaussian Elimination and Back substitution
            - LU decomposition
            - Cholesky decomposition
            - Gauss-Jordan method
            - Jacobi Iterative method
            - Gauss-Seidel iterative method
            - Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)
            - Thomas Algorithm for tridiagonal matrix
            The above numerical methods will be coded in Python (manual method)
            and then the available automatic functions from scipy will be used. 
            Finally the results will be compared
           
Homework 6:
            Slving systems of non-linear equations
            Newton-Jacobia was coded manually and used from automatic functions from Scipy
            Linear regression (linear and polynomial fitting equation)
         
Homework 7:
            practice on sklearn regression. 
            Many regressions have been performed in different scenarios
            
Homework 8: 
            In this homework, different methods for solving 2nd order ODEs are included. 
            Some of the methods include: 
            - Explicit Euler
            - Dormand-Prince 5(4)
            - Lobatto IIIC 3rd order
            At the end, all methods are compared to the potential analytical solutions for verification purpose
